Homework 5 File Repository

For the Alice application i had made a game from scrath as i followed the tutorials but the application froze and crashed before i saved. The original game was similar to the one 
im submitting just the environment wasnt as flshed out in regards to the scenery. I reimplemented the actions i had from the previous project into one 
of the pre-built full scenes. I just added the characters, events, and collision to it and didnt alter scenery much in the pre-built world. I mention this to state that i 
did work with the environment initially but when i lost it it just seemed easier to use the pre-built environment and add the actions back.
