            <h3>Homework 2: Code.Org Drawing</h3>
            <img src="./images/artist-final-creation.png" height="500" width="500">
            <p>
                For our first project we worked in Code.org to expermient with drag and drop coding.
                Here we created a sketch using drag and drop functions. This is what I created.
                Introduce yourself to coding at <a href="https://code.org/" target="_blank">Code.org</a>.

            <h3>Homework 3: Scratch Project</h3>
            <img src="./images/scratch.jpg" height="500" width="700">
            <p>
                Next we went into Scratch to work more with drag and drop functions with a bit more functionality.
                Here we created a scene using objects. We made these objects move across the screen and talk to each other
                by using a send/receive message function. We learned more about loops and in depth functions in this project.

            <h3>Homework 4: Code.org and App Lab</h3>
            <p>
                Next we created a minigame in web format using <a href="https://code.org/" target="_blank">Code.org</a>. 
                We also used <a href="https://code.org/educate/applab" target="_blank">App Lab</a> to create an online mobile app using their custom tools. 
                These tools gave us an introduction to creating web applications using drag and drop code.

            <h3>Homework 5: Alice Project</h3>
            <img src="./images/alice.jpg" height="400" width="600">
            <p>
                Next we moved on to Alice. Alice allowed us to explore much more functionallity and depth using drag and drop controls.
                Here we were able to build an environment, control the camera, and create objects to function within our environment all using
                the tools that are given. Alice is a great introduction tool to create intricate projects without having to do any coding by hand.
                It is also a great tool to introduce the intricacies of coding through its thourough drag and drop tools. I created a swamp environment 
                where the player controlled a manatee and navigated the swamp. There were also NPC for the player to interact with. Get 
                <a href="https://www.alice.org/get-alice/alice-3/" target="_blank">Alice 3</a> and see what you can create!

            <h3>Homework 6-8: HTML and CSS</h3>
            <p>
                For our first webpage we were tasked with creating a few pages consisting of our favorite hobbies, a story we like and artwork we have done.
                These basic pages were introduction to using links, styling and images in a web page. The page also has a contact form page to work on input formatting
                and dealing with forms in html. We learned in later homeworks how to do additional styling with backgrounds, links, color, etc. We also implemented validation
                on the contact form to make sure it contained input before submission was possible. I also included a math game in the site to learn how to deal with user input
                and handle updating the page properly while the user was playing the game. Visit the finished page below.

            <h3>Homework 9: Sketch using JavaScript</h3>
            <img src="./images/self-portrait-initial.jpg" width="400" height="400">
            <p>
                This project was my introduction into using JavaScript. We started our introduction with creating a self portrait using JavaScript sketch functionallity.
                Here we could draw shapes and text onto a canvas. Doing so you can create whatever you can come up with using basic shapes!
            </p>

            <h3>Homework 10: Adding Motion (JS)</h3>
            <p>
                Our next project was taking the self portrait that we created and adding motion! We used if statements to control the movement of the shapes and then bound them to give
                the appearance of quick movement. This project was our introduction to loops and moving parts using JavaScript. Check out the moving portrait below.

            <h3>Homework 11-13: Circle Game</h3>
            <p>
                Next we took the JavaScript to another level. We used our new skills using sketch to create a game where the player plays as a circle that needs to reach the exit
                of the canvas while 'avoiding' the enemies. The user can also click to put up blockades against the enemies. If the player reached the end the game will return to them that
                they have won. (Note: There are actually no collisions in the game so getting hit by an enemy wont end the game. We were just implementing the basics). We continued this project
                in following homeworks implementing functions, loops and arrays in JavaScript. Check out the final game down below.
